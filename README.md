# Bank-Loan-Recommendation-Tool
We are going to use past financial data for loans that have been applied for at a bank. We are able to see through all this past data trends of what would be seen as a risk to give certain people loans. We want to be able to create a bank loan recommendation tool.

Step 1. Define the data elements we will use to analyze to help us reach the final outcome

The elements we will not use from the data include:


id - we do not need for our use case
address_state - we believed this was irrelevant
emp_title - per the verification status, there were some that were verified and others that were not
verification_status - of the emp_title

next meeting we will figure out how to read the data and find the correlation between the elements
